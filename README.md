## How to install JDK
Remember, the Java Development Kit (JDK) needs to be installed on your system for these commands to work. If it's not installed, you can download and install it from the official Oracle website or use an alternative like OpenJDK.

If you're using an IDE like Eclipse, IntelliJ, or NetBeans, the process may vary slightly. You can typically run your program directly from the IDE without explicitly using the command line for compilation and execution.

### Here are general steps to download the Oracle JDK:

- Visit the Oracle JDK Download Page:
Go to the Oracle JDK download page: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/.

- Accept the License Agreement:
On the download page, you will find a section with Oracle JDK versions. Scroll down, find the version you want to download, and accept the license agreement by clicking the checkbox.

- Select the Download Link:
Click on the download link that corresponds to your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

- Download the Installer:
You may need to log in with an Oracle account to access the downloads. Once logged in, download the installer for your operating system.

- Install the JDK:
After downloading, run the installer and follow the installation instructions. The installer will guide you through the process of installing the Java Development Kit on your system.

Keep in mind that there are also alternative JDK distributions available, such as OpenJDK. Depending on your needs and preferences, you might choose a different distribution. For OpenJDK, you can typically find it in the package manager of your Linux distribution or download it from the official OpenJDK website.

Always refer to the official websites for the most accurate and up-to-date information. If you encounter any difficulties, Oracle's website usually provides documentation and support resources.
